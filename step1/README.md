# A11y

## Step 1 - What is a11y

To be good at a11y first we have to understand that a11y is not just about screen readers.
It is about all sorts of barriers we may encounter while trying to use your software.

Microsoft has made a good chart to illustrate this well:

Things that help make your software more accessible could be:

- Have a no-mouse day that is dedicated to you doing your day-to-day work with your keyboard only
- Use your software while closing your eyes
- Listen to your users and find out where their struggles are
- Lots of empathy
- Use semantic HTML
